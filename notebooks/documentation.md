1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - The script starts by importing necessary libraries such as `os`, `numpy`, `cv2` (OpenCV), `tensorflow`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
   - Specific modules and functions from TensorFlow and Keras are also imported to facilitate model construction and training.

2. **Setting Constants**:
   - Constants such as `IMAGE_SIZE`, `EPOCHS`, `BATCH`, and `LR` are defined for configuring the data preprocessing, training, and model parameters.

3. **Loading Data**:
   - The `load_data` function is defined to load and split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
   - Images and corresponding masks are loaded from specified directories and split into the desired proportions.

4. **Preprocessing Functions**:
   - Two functions, `read_image` and `read_mask`, are defined to read and preprocess images and masks, respectively.
   - Images are resized and normalized, while masks are resized, normalized, and converted to grayscale.
   - TensorFlow functions (`tf_parse` and `tf_dataset`) are defined to parse and create TensorFlow datasets from the loaded data.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Some sample images and masks from the training set are visualized using Matplotlib to ensure the data loading and preprocessing are correct.

6. **Model Architecture**:
   - The U-Net architecture is implemented with a MobileNetV2 encoder for feature extraction.
   - Skip connections are utilized to concatenate feature maps from the encoder with upsampled feature maps from the decoder.
   - Convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation are used for feature transformation.
   - The final layer applies sigmoid activation to produce binary segmentation masks.

7. **Loss and Metrics**:
   - Custom loss function (`dice_loss`) and metric (`dice_coef`) are defined for evaluating the model performance.
   - Additional metrics such as recall and precision are also included.

8. **Model Compilation and Training**:
   - The model is compiled with Nadam optimizer and the defined loss and metrics.
   - Callbacks such as ReduceLROnPlateau and EarlyStopping are utilized to monitor the validation loss and prevent overfitting.
   - The model is trained using the prepared training and validation datasets.

9. **Model Saving and Loading**:
   - After training, the model is saved to a specified directory.
   - The saved model is then loaded for evaluation on the test dataset.

10. **Model Evaluation and Prediction Visualization**:
    - The performance of the model is evaluated on the test dataset using the `evaluate` method.
    - Finally, sample images from the test set along with their ground truth masks and predicted masks are visualized for qualitative assessment of the model.
